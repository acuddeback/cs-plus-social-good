                admissions season to send one or more transcripts while still using your current system.  We'd love to get your

              <p>Last fall, while applying to transfer to her fourth university, one of our co-founders thought the task of accumulating
                her past transcripts from two high schools and three colleges would be a simple one.  Unfortunately, it took her days to
                figure out how she was supposed to get ahold of them, only to later discover that several of the transcripts she had sent
                digitally never arrived at her new school just days before the deadline approached.  She ended up having to drive to two of
                her past schools and pay enormous fees for express shipping, just for the opportunity to apply to a college.  Her experience,
                along with many students who go through this slow, disorganized process is the reason EmblemEDU was founded:  to place
                ownership into the students' hands to simplify the process for all parties involved.  In a digital age, sending transcripts
                should be as easy as sending an email.</p>
